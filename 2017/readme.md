### Neglected tabs and inspiring materia

I didn't do a good job of tracking all of the reading material I have looked at
since December of last year, partly because of trying out other platforms (see
[my refind®](https://refind.com/newswim)). But here we go again. One of these
days, I'll categorize everything and put them all into a big resource bucket. Right?
