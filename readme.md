### Link and Resource Archive

# > For most recent articles, look at [what i've saved so far from 2016](https://github.com/newswim/article-archive/blob/master/Feb%202016%20-%20Dec%202016/readme.md).

Eventually I'll turn this into an actual blog. The format is pretty rough and I
had no intention of ever doing anything with this collection but was obsessively
tracking articles that I'd checked out during my first year or so of web
development (learning).
