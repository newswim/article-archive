###  A giant list of articles whose titles was titillating.

## - [2016 archive](https://github.com/newswim/article-archive/blob/master/Feb%202016%20-%20Dec%202016/readme.md)
## - [2017 archive](https://github.com/newswim/article-archive/tree/master/2017)

The plan is to turn this into an actual website with ratings/summaries eventually, but for now it's just an overwhelming list (but searchable! Thanks, github!).

I tend to think of this mostly a means of tracking my development and interests over time.. notice there there are far fewer articles added this year. I've tended to stick closer to source documentation more recently, but there's lots of good content in there.

Also, I've started saving a lot of things on [Refind/newswim](https://refind.com/newswim), it's a pretty nice interface and has a nice "read soon" feature.
