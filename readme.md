The plan is to turn this into an actual website with ratings/summaries eventually, but for now it's
just an overwhelming list (but searchable! Thanks, github!). This repo is mainly a means of tracking
my development and interests over time.. notice there there are far fewer articles added this year.
I could speculate why.... Also, I've started saving a lot of things to [Refind/newswim](https://refind.com/newswim),
it's a pretty nice interface and has a nice "read soon" feature. I still feel like there isn't a
terrific way to save and search through material that interests you, but maybe one day!
