### >>>> For most recent articles, look at [what i've saved so far from 2016](https://github.com/newswim/article-archive/blob/master/Feb%202016%20-%20The%20Future/readme.md). <<<<

Eventually I'll turn this into an actual blog.. the format is pretty rough, I had no intention of ever doing anything with this collection but was obsessively tracking articles and things that I'd checked out during my first year or so of web development (learning).

If [roots.cx](http://roots.cx/) has a markdown-parser that will render templates, i'll probably use that. Otherwise, probably Jekyll or Hexo. There is a proposal for Roots v4 which looks really interesting [(article)](https://medium.com/@jescalan/eaa10c75eb22#.vip37pdlo). Alternatively, I can export the original hackpad document as html (or .txt for that matter) -- could easily convert to jade, etc.
